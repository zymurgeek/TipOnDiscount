	    To calculate a tip, press the New icon (+) on the action 
	    bar above.  Depending on your Android device, the soft keyboard 
	    will pop up and you can enter the numbers from your bill, 
 	    moving between fields with the Next button on the keyboard.
 	    There\'s no Calculate button&#8212;all values are calculated as
 	    you enter them.
 	    \n
 	    \nThe Settings icon will let you enter defaults for tax
 	    percent, tip percent and rounding.  When you press the
 	    New icon, these defaults will be filled in for you.
 	    \n
 	    \nIf you normally pay with a credit card, leave rounding off.
 	    If you like to pay cash, set the rounding to an even amount,
 	    such as a dollar, and your total will be rounded up to the nearest
 	    dollar.  This way you won\'t have to wait for change.  When
 	    you use rounding, you can also use the bump buttons, which
 	    will raise or lower your amount due by the rounding amount.
 	    Look at the actual tip at the bottom to see how this works.
 	    \n
 	    \nLastly, if you\'re splitting a bill evenly, each party\'s 
 	    amount due will be rounded to the "round up to" amount.
