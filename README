Tip On Discount is a free Android tip calculator with NO ADS and NO
REQUIRED PERMISSIONS.  It figures a tip based on the actual cost of a
meal.  The actual cost is the amount paid on the bill, excluding sales
tax, but including any discounts that were applied.  This insures your
server gets tipped fairly.

TOD will split a bill between multiple parties and let you round each
share to, say, the nearest dollar.  It will show you the actual tip
percentage after rounding.  TOD also supports bumping the tip up
or down to the next rounded amount.

There is no "calculate" button in TOD.  All calculations are performed
on the fly as you type.

The code makes full use of JUnit test cases and Android JUnit test
cases.  Since it is a relatively small application, it should be
useful to those who want to learn Android development and automated
unit testing.

To build this software, you'll need the Android SDK.  See
http://developer.android.com

If you haven't already, create the Android Support library project
using the v7 appcompat library.  See:
http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html

If you have your SDK in a different location than in your home
directory, or you have a different version of the SDK, you'll need to
update that location in App/project.properties.  You can do this in
Eclipse using the instructions in "Adding libraries with resources"
(expand "Using Eclipse"):
http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html#libs-with-res

Note that the "library pane" the instructions reference is listed
under the "Android" category in the list on the left of the Properties
dialog.  This documentation issue has been reported:
http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=61239

Once the support library is ready, import the code from the Elipse
menu File -> Import.  Expand General and select Existing Projects into
Workspace.  Select Browse next to "Select root directory" and select
the TipOnDiscount top level directory.  Three projects, TipOnDiscount,
TipOnDiscountAndroidJUnitTests and TipOnDiscountJUnitTests, will be
selected.  Select Finish.

To run the JUnit tests, you'll need JMock 2.6 (http://jmock.org/).
This is optional, but recommended if you'll be modifying code.
Download the Binary JARs and unzip them to a location of your choice.
In Eclipse, set JMOCK_HOME to the new JMock directory, e.g.,
/home/myuser/jmock-2.6.0 for Linux or c:\jmock-2.6.0 for Windows.  To
do this, from the Eclipse menu, select Window -> Preferences.  In the
left pane, expand Java and then Build Path.  Select Classpath
Variables.  On the right, select New.  Set the Name to JMOCK_HOME and
select Folder next to Path.  Select the new JMock directory.  The
tests can be run by right-clicking on the TipOnDiscountJUnitTests
project and selecting Run As > JUnit Test.  These tests are very
fast--the entire suite runs in under a second even on older hardware.

To run the Android JUnit tests, start an emulator supporting API 7 or
greater.  for help, see
http://developer.android.com/tools/help/emulator.html.  Once the
emulator is running, right click on the TipOnDiscountAndroidJUnitTests
project and select Run As > Android JUnit Test.  After you start the
test, bring up the emulator window and watch as the tests put the app
through its paces.  Since these tests are running on the emulator,
they're a lot slower than the JUnit tests and take a few minutes to
finish.
