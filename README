Tip On Discount is an Android tip calculator.  It figures a tip based
on the actual cost of a meal.  The actual cost is the amount paid on
the bill, excluding sales tax, but including any discounts that were
applied.  This insures your server gets tipped fairly.

TOD will split a bill between multiple parties and let you round each
share to, say, the nearest dollar.  It will show you the actual tip
percentage after rounding.  TOD also supports bumping the tip up
or down to the next rounded amount.

There is no "calculate" button in TOD.  All calculations are performed
on the fly as you type.

The code makes full use of JUnit test cases and Android JUnit test
cases.  Since it is a relatively small application, it should be
useful to those who want to learn Android development and automated
unit testing.

To build this software, you'll need the Android SDK.  See
http://developer.android.com.  Once installed, import the code from
the Elipse menu File -> Import.  Expand General and select Existing
Projects into Workspace.  Select Browse next to "Select root
directory" and select the TipOnDiscount top level directory.  Three
projects, TipOnDiscount, TipOnDiscountAndroidJUnitTests and
TipOnDiscountJUnitTests, will be selected.  Select Finish.

To run the JUnit tests, you'll need JMock 2.6 (http://jmock.org/).
Download the Binary JARs and unzip them to a location of your choice.
In Eclipse, set JMOCK_HOME to the new JMock directory, e.g.,
/home/myuser/jmock-2.6.0.  To do this, from the Eclipse menu, select
Window -> Preferences.  In the left pane, expand Java and then Build
Path.  Select Classpath Variables.  On the right, select New.  Set the
Name to JMOCK_HOME and select Folder next to Path.  Select the new
JMock directory.
