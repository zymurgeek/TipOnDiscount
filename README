Tip On Discount is an Android tip calculator.  It figures a tip based
on the actual cost of a meal.  The actual cost is the amount paid on
the bill, excluding sales tax, but including any discounts that were
applied.  This insures your server gets tipped fairly.

TOD will split a bill between multiple parties and let you round each
share to, say, the nearest dollar.  It will show you the actual tip
percentage after rounding.  TOD also supports bumping the tip up
or down to the next rounded amount.

There is no "calculate" button in TOD.  All calculations are performed
on the fly as you type.

The code makes full use of JUnit test cases and Android JUnit test
cases.  Since it is a relatively small application, it should be
useful to those who want to learn Android development and automated
unit testing.
